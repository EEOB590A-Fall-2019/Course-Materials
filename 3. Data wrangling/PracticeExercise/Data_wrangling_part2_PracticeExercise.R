#from the tidy folder, read in the partialtidy file for pollination from last week's assignment

#####Part 1: finish tidying & wrangling dataframe #########

#1) Broad changes to the database

#1a) Change the class of each variable as appropriate (i.e. make things into factors or numeric)

#2) Fix the errors below within cells 

##2a) Fix the levels of site so that they have consistent names, all in lowercase

##2b) What format are the dates in? Do they look okay? 

##2c) Do you see any other errors that should be cleaned up? 

#3) Create a new column for the duration of time traps were out

#4) Arrange data by the number of insects

#5) Print tidied, wrangled database

####Part 3: start subsetting & summarizing ##########

#6) Make a new dataframe with just the data from Guam at the racetrack site and name accordingly. 

#7) Make a new dataframe with just the uniqueID, island, site, transect, insectorder, numinsects, and duration columns. 

#8) With the full database (not the new ones you created in the two previous steps), summarize data, to get: 
#8a) a table with the total number of insects at each site
#8b) a table that shows the mean number of insects per island
#8c) a table that shows the min and max number of insects per transect

#9a) Figure out which insect order is found across the greatest number of sites

#9b) For that insect order, calculate the mean and sd by site.
